# Low-Pass Filter based Remez Algorithm

Remez Low Pass Filter implementation in Matlab (USTC EE Digital Signal Processing course project)



This project is to realize an optimal low-pass filter (LPF) based on the "remez" exchange algorithm.

Of course you can use this kind of algorithm to realize high-pass, band-pass and any other kinds of filters, just by modifying it a little.

See [result](./result/) and [source code](./src/) folders for details.
